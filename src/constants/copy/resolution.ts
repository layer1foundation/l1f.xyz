    list: `We commit to the pursuit of simplicity in our technical architecture whenever possible, except where doing so might pose potential hazards to BRC20 assets. We strive for an uncomplicated protocol design to enhance accessibility and ease of use—and to prevent technical debts or complications as the protocol evolves. 
    We commit to a safety-first approach when making changes to the protocol or its indexers. We prioritize the security and reliability of the protocol by ensuring rigorous testing and validation—and will collaborate on timely identification and resolution of potential vulnerabilities. 
    We commit to fostering mutual discussion and considering our community when pursuing changes in development. Major changes to the index will be thoroughly discussed amongst partners within at least one difficulty adjustment (~2 weeks), ensuring that consensus-building is a key element in shaping the protocol.
    We commit to making protocol-level changes open-source—enabling transparency and scrutiny from the wider community. This transparency not only builds trust among stakeholders but ensures that decision-making is inclusive of a diverse range of user interests. 
    We commit to the broader value of decentralization—emphasizing that any changes to the protocol should prioritize the protocol's best interests. Updates should not seek to benefit individual entities or organizations but rather serve the collective interests of BRC20 users.`,

    description: `The Layer 1 Foundation and its partners recognize the critical importance of fostering a collaborative approach in the ongoing development and maintenance of the BRC20 protocol. To achieve this, the Layer 1 Foundation and its partners put forth the following resolution as an outline of key principles we aim to pursue as collective maintainers of this technology.`,

    content: `By prioritizing these pillars, we strive to create a resilient and user-friendly ecosystem—fostering trust within the broader Bitcoin community. Users must always come first, and through this resolution, we aim to ensure that the BRC20 protocol remains reliable and inclusive.

Additionally, partners will refer to the following Standard Operating Procedure for specific suggestions on how we may embody these principles as we co-develop this technology. 

Together, we affirm our steadfast dedication to safeguarding the well-being of BRC20 users—nurturing innovation while respecting user sovereignty, safety, and usability.

Our current signatory parties include: Layer 1 Foundation, Domo, Unisat, Best In Slot, Oyl Dynamics, ALEX, UTXO Management, Allium & Hiro`,
